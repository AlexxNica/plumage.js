<h3>What is Plumage.js?</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Plumage is a UI framework for building data intensive, private web apps, including
    internal tools and authenticated public services.</strong>
</p>
<p>It's built on <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>,
and incorparates other 3rd party components, notably <a href="https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid">SlickGrid</a>.</p>

<h3>How Does Plumage relate to X?</h3>

<p>
  Plumage is not an MVC framework. It's an app building toolkit for building a specific type of app.
  From the foundation of MVC, it adds a collection of common, standardized building blocks, and ways to rapidly, and systematically put them together.
</p>

<p>It's built on <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a> for MVC, chosen for its simplicity, however the same patterns could be implemented on other MVC frameworks like Angular or Ember.</p>

<p>And its great looks are thanks to <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap's</a> CSS.</p>

<p>Plumage Views are based on Backbone Views, but I would like to try implementing them with Facebook React at some point.</p>

<h3>Why Plumage.js?</h3>

<p>
  Web development is naturally focused on public sites, and with public sites, page load is king. The longer the page load,
  the longer the visitor contemplates hitting the back button. This is why most JS frameworks try to be minimal &mdash;
  More JS &rarrow; higher bounce rate.
</p>

<p>
  However, in private web apps, the user is not going to bounce if initial load takes 3 seconds (see gmail loading bar).
  Also, since users stick around, its actually subsequent load times that are perceived as performance. So, in private apps
  more JS is not a big deal. What benefits can we get with more JS? We can get a unified and coherent framework
  for constructing complex UI, and we can stop reinventing the wheel, using the standard components that come with it.
</p>

<p>
  Private apps also tend to be more complex, with large numbers of Views for displaying and modifying different
  related models from a complicated model hierarchy. Simplifying the model can only go so far,
  restricted by the inherent complexity of the app's domain. Plumage provides a systematic way for constructing and
  manipulating complex model and view hierarchies.
</p>

<p>
  So Plumage's values are:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Developer Productivity</strong> - Systematic approach - one way of doing things. Batteries included - don't reinvent the wheel.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Complexity Management</strong> - Modularization, separation of concerns, declarative config.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Subsequent Load Time</strong> - One page load, async everything, efficient rendering.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h3>The View Hierarchy</h3>

<p>
When your data is complex, the view hierarchy for a dashboard app can get complicated fast.

<img class="screen-shot" src="images/component-hierarchy.png"></img>

<p class="caption">
One such <a href="/examples/kitchen_sink/view">View</a> hierarchy.
</p>

<p>
No monolithic views. Every aspect of the DataSource gets its own View class. Each
related model also gets its own Views and subviews. All these views are nested together into a hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
Modular views improve reuse, understandability, and separation of concerns.
</p>

<p>
Modular views also simplify your design, because views don't know about each other.
Leaf Views (views with no subviews) can't affect other Views because they don't know about them, and Container Views
(views with subviews) are mostly glue, so behavior remains predictable.
No huge template files, no monolithic views filled with spaghetti, and no global event bus.
</p>

<h3>Model Binding</h3>

<p>
Modular views are great, but now we have this large hierarchy of nested views that need to be
populated with the correct models from the model graph, which can also get complex.
</p>

<img class="screen-shot" src="images/model-hierarchy.png"></img>
<p class="caption">
Model Relationships from the above pictured app.
</p>
<p>
How do you bind each View in the View hierarchy to the correct <a href="/examples/kitchen_sink/model">Model</a>
in the Model Hierarchy? Don't do it manually with code. Do it declaratively.
</p>
<p>
Each view is configured with a path into the model graph. The model graph visits each View
with the Model, and the View uses the path to walk the Model hierarchy and get the correct Model.
</p>

<p>
  This separates concerns in a few ways:
  <ol>
    <li><p>
      <strong>Each View binds directly to the Model it displays.</strong>
      No getting models from a global store, or from parent views.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
      <strong>Container views don't need to know anything about their subviews.</strong>
    </p></li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h3>Event Handling</h3>

<p>
When you have a complex view hierarchy, another factor that needs deciding is where to handle UI events.
</p>
<p>Here it's necessary to take a more nuanced approach than with model binding:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>
If a UI event doesn't affect anything outside
the view it's triggered on, including that view's model, it can be safely handled in that view. This is great
of reuse. The triggered behavior will exist in all instances of that view.
</p></li>
<li><p>
If a UI event handler is specific to your App, with no chance for reuse, handle it in
the Controller. The big advantage of this is that it's consistent! Follow this policy you'll know exactly where to find
your event handlers.
</p></li>
<li><p>
If the situation is in between, you'll have to decide where in the view hierarchy to handle it.
One restriction is that it needs to be in a View high enough in the hierarchy that it contains all the views that the event
will affect.
</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Batteries Included</h3>

<p>
  Pretty much every data intensive app needs a grid that supports sorting, searching, filtering and infinite scroll.
  The same goes for a lot of other components like advanced <a href="/examples/kitchen_sink/form">form fields</a>, comments and more.
</p>
<p>
  Plumage incorporates many 3rd party components, including notably SlickGrid for <a href="/examples/kitchen_sink/grid">grids</a>, and wraps them in the consistent
  interface of a Plumage View, allowing you to make use of them without learning their own ideosyncrasies.
  Just configure the view, and bind the model.
</p>

<h3>In Conclusion...</h3>
<p>
  Most talk about javascript UI understandably focus on the early stages of an apps life, with
  little afforded to dealing with issues of complexity that show up later on.

  The patterns in plumage are a way to handle this complexity in a standard way without going crazy.
